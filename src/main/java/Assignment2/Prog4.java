 * <br/>
 * Create a class Prog4. Inside its main method, create float variables to store each of the following
 * numbers:<br/>
 * 1.27, 3.881, 9.6<br/><br/>
 * Output to the console the following two values:
 * 1. the sum of the floats as an integer, obtained by casting the sum to type int
 * 2. the sum of the floats as an integer, obtained by rounding the sum to the nearest integer, using the
 * Math.round function
